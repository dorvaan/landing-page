# landing-page

This project was one of the first of The Odin Project.  It gave us an image with a design of a layout that I needed to create based on what I had learned up until this point.

The hardest part for me was using the FlexBox component to get things laid out where I needed them.  Nested containers, particularly in the call to action section were difficult for me to grasp. It actually took taking a break for a couple of days and coming back to it for the final piece of the puzzle for me to click.
